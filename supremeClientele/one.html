The song "one" has a legendary beat produced by Juju and an epic flow by Ghostface Killa. The album is 
amazing but this song truly sets an immaculate tone for what's to come. I remember the first time that I 
heard this song, I was in awe of Ghostface Killa's flow on the beat. I kept playing it on repeat.
